# EDA-and-Visualizations
Exploratory data analysis and data visualizations on an Olympic Data set in python using numpy , pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. This project uses inferential statistics, correlation, plots, and maps between variables.
The data was ripped from kaggle and I created plots and asked questions surrounding the Olympics I was intersted in.
